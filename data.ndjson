How does it work and how does it differ from other companies in the same field?BRICKX is an Australian first allowing everyone to be able to invest in residential investment property without requiring the funds to acquire the entire property. Each property sits in an individual trust, which is split into 10,000 units (or Bricks as we call them). Owning a Brick entitles you to receive your share of the rental income every month, and investors are also eligible to earn Capital Returns as the Brick Value and price changes. Our platform allows investors to invest (from under $100) easily, with control over which properties they invest in, when to invest and also when to sell.\u00a0 A Port Melbourne house which has just launched on BrickX's platform.[/caption]Q. What are some of the major trends in the investment sector? How does BRICKX help people respond to these trends?Without question, the last three years have shown phenomenal growth in most of Sydney and Melbourne, however from an investment perspective it is the fortunate minority who have benefited from this, with many first home buyers and investors being locked out of the property market not only due to affordability reasons, but also due to how fiercely contested each auction has become. Residential property investments are extremely lumpy investments, and often provide little opportunity for diversification within an investor's portfolio. BRICKX changes this, by allowing people to invest in a fraction of the property and the ability to diversify across different properties. We\u2019re not crowd-funders as we buy the properties up front enabling us to be very competitive in this challenging market (we don\u2019t think crowdfunding can work in such a fiercely contested market).Q.\u00a0What do\u00a0you\u00a0believe is the best investment opportunity?\u00a0Investors will likely have different strategies and reasons for investing, from diversification, to choosing higher income yielding investments, or perhaps only investing in the properties with gearing (debt). One of the many benefits of BRICKX is in providing investors with a diverse offering so that they can execute their own investment strategy. The properties are selected in line with a mandate set by our Property Team, which includes Tim Lawless (Head of Research at Core Logic) and Nerida Conisbee (Chief Economist at\u00a0realestate.com) and our wider buying team. We conduct all the due diligence you might expect when buying a property, and are currently looking at options in highly desirable suburbs where there is a long history of capital growth performance, strong tenant demand and limited opportunity for large scale development. This is represented by the suburbs we are invested in Double Bay, Bondi Beach, Mosman, Enmore, Annandale (in Sydney) and in Melbourne, Prahran and Port Melbourne.Q.\u00a0Do you think the current trends are likely to change? Do you see any emerging trends on the horizon?The Property Team gets together every quarter to analyse the macroeconomic and more localised situations, which helps us focus on the key areas to invest. We remain bullish for Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, however the widespread growth that has been seen over the last three years will not be so easy to repeat, and we\u2019re focused on buying the right types of properties in the right suburbs. At the moment we would be avoiding large unit blocks in Melbourne CBD and Brisbane CBD as there has been (and continues to be) a lot of construction and new properties coming on to the market.Q.\u00a0What are some of the mistakes or pitfalls that potential investors regularly face?We constantly remind our investors that property prices can go down as well as up! The last few years and some short term memories will contribute towards people thinking residential investment property is a sure bet. The reality is that prices are a function of supply and demand which is often driven by wider confidence, economic factors, interest rates etc. As an asset class, residential property has outperformed all other significant asset classes (source ASX) over the last 20 years, but property does go through cycles.Q.\u00a0Are there any hot tips or tricks you\u2019ve picked up over the years that help you with your work?Don\u2019t confine your thinking!The real estate sector is one of the last to see technology advancements disrupt the status quo. Over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve seen many new businesses start-up in the Property Technology (PropTech) sector which leverage technology and connectivity to provide new options and improvements to the way that people interact with this asset class, from virtual reality to investing.\u00a0Q.\u00a0What drives you? What keeps you motivated?Simply put, finding opportunities to build businesses which put solving a consumer problem at the heart of it. By leveraging technology, I'm able to quickly develop new ideas and products which aim to improve the lives of those my team and I interact with."]

Investa Property Group lodged plans to demolish the 1950s modernist-era building, the first high rise in North Sydney.But its plans unravelled as the New South Wales government architect and Special Minister of State Don Harwin stepped in to support the property\u2019s state heritage listing, following a public outcry.Investa objected to the potential listing of the MLC Building on the state heritage register, citing a 2013 decision by the NSW heritage council not to list the building as it wasn\u2019t of \u201csignificance to the state\u201d, but to no avail\u2014the building was added to the register in June 2021. Amended plans were submitted to North Sydney Council in late December and the case is before the Land and Environment Court this week as Investa looks to salvage its $500-million plans for a 27-storey commercial tower on the 6640sq m site. In November, Investa was granted leave by the court to resubmit plans with amended heritage and environmental effects statements.Following the resubmission of the development application and the revised documents relating to the integrated development and state heritage listing, the matter was listed for a directions hearing this week. A conciliation conference is slated for March and, if an agreement is not reached, the matter will return to court.In initial appeal court documents, filed in August 2021, Investa sought to have its appeal upheld and be granted approval to demolish the existing MLC Building to make way for a 27-storey commercial tower. Investa has also commenced judicial proceedings against Special Minister Don Harwin challenging his capacity to \u201cdirect the listing of the MLC Building on the State Heritage Register\u201d.The building at 105-153 Miller Street is wholly owned by the Oxford Investa Properties Partnership\u2014one of six assets making up its $2.3-billion portfolio.According to the NSW Valuer General the land alone is valued at $57.4 million.The Bates Smart proposal was touted as North Sydney\u2019s first net zero commercial building, targeting a 6-star Green Star office design rating and 5.5-star NABERS Energy Rating. Investa chief executive Jonathan Callaghan said the existing commercial tower could not meet modern tenant expectations.\u201cThe office market is evolving \u2026 the B-grade space that [the MLC building] offers in North Sydney is no longer relevant for that market,\u201d Callaghan said. Ethos Urban\u2019s revised statement of environmental effects claims a reconstruction of the ageing building would cost about $120 million and was not commercially viable.The report said the building was past its use-by-date with complex works required, including the replacement of facade tiles, the replacement of a leaking east-west double skin facade and the replacement of the building\u2019s plant equipment, services and elevators.\u201cThe building services have passed their intended lifespan \u2026 the existing building fit-out has an aged and complicated fire-proofing system that limits the flexibility of new fit-outs for multiple tenants and requires a complete replacement to accommodate tenant fit-out requirements,\u201d the report said. \u201cTypically, modern commercial office buildings are designed and constructed with an overall life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.\u201cThe cumulative sum of these issues requires the building to be stripped back to its structural system and reconstructed again. This is a substantially complex and costly design and construction exercise to restore it to the level that retains its architectural integrity. \u201cAn independent quantity survey of the necessary restoration works outlined above has been costed at approximately $118 million. \u201cIt is not economically viable for the owner, or any likely future owner, to expend such a significant amount of capital on an asset which cannot attract the necessary increase in rents required to fund it.\u201dBates Smart, also the original architect of the MLC Building, said it had worked for more than a decade to find a feasible solution to avoid demolition but it was not viable.  In planning documents the firm supported the demolition, saying \u201cBates Smart are highly aware of the importance and legacy of this pioneering piece of architecture\u201d.\u201cOur aim is to design a building in the spirit of MLC that is as pioneering for the 21st century as MLC was for the late 20th century, creating a new legacy for North Sydney in the 21st century,\u201d the report said. The Bates Smart & McCutcheon-designed MLC Building at North Sydney was completed in 1957 and was the first high-rise building in the area.Ahead of its time, the building was the first to incorporate a glass curtain wall facade system, heralding the era of decentralisation of Sydney\u2019s CBD. It is constructed from lightweight steel, due to scarcity of materials in the post-war era. At the time of its opening in 1957, it was the largest office building in Australia with a gross area of almost 42,000sq m across 14 storeys and a frontage of 100 metres.The building also features bas-relief sculpture by Andor M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros and decorative sandstone garden sculptures by Gerald Lewers. In a revised heritage impact statement, Vault Heritage Consulting director Malcolm Elliott supported the bid to demolish the MLC Building.\u201cIt is considered that the proposed demolition of the MLC Building\u2014an integral component of the proposal\u2014is an acceptable development outcome despite the resultant impact it will have on the heritage listing of the site,\u201d he says. \u201c[It should be approved] subject to the imposition of appropriate heritage conditions in relation to archival recording, retention of significant items of moveable heritage.\u201dElliott supported RPS\u2019 initial heritage impact statement and recommendation for the retention of heritage items, archiving and reusing where possible within the new development.

However, one bad tenant is all it can take to ultimately damage a short-term letting investment, as well as the reputation of the investor. Despite heated opinions on the issue, it is clear that the rapid growth of the online accommodation platform Airbnb has generated immense discussion around the future of our cities \u2013 especially as the traditional buy-to-let market gives way to a more contemporary short-term rental market.With the unprecedented growth of the short-term letting market, a string of fears have arisen in both neighbours, strata managers and body corporates of properties that are using the help of platforms like Airbnb to generate additional income. If these fears are not properly addressed, they can damage the reputation between the investor and the stakeholders while also minimising any potential returns from the property.However, there exists premium Airbnb management services \u2013 like Airsorted \u2013 who understand the nuances of the short-term letting industry, and can guide homeowners on how to protect their asset while securing returns that, in some cases, are up to 110 per cent more than typical long-term rentals. To get the most out of a short-term rental asset, there are a number of ways that investors can mitigate the risk associated with online platforms such as Airbnb. From vetting potential guests, to engaging a management company \u2013 here are 7 tips that will help owners better manage their investment. Related: The Secret Super Suburbs for Property InvestorsInvesting in an Airbnb property means a stream of ever-changing guests that will need to be checked in and managed \u2013 by allowing someone to take control of this, while managing and mediating any issues, it can simplify the entire process. Investors should choose a management company that has internal guest vetting processes and that invoices for their services while remaining professional and easy to communicate with.  If an investor chooses to manage their rental without a management service, they should be aware that Airbnb has various verification settings to help attract the perfect guests. Before accepting all potential bookings for profit purposes, these settings can be used to check that the property is only going to be booked by the right people. The platform offers the option to ask for verified accounts with photo ID or positive reviews from other hosts, before they can book the property instantly.It is also good practice to ask guests the purpose of their stay and whether they will be bringing any guests.If a guest attempts to book the property and they are travelling alone and are from the same city, this can be a major red flag. Always triple check with the guests the reason they are wanting to stay at the property and don\u2019t hesitate to turn guests away if the activity seems suspicious. Although single night bookings can be profitable in the short-term, a greater turn-over of guests can harm the property\u2019s reputation in the long run. Daily guests not only carry a greater risk of parties or disturbances, it could also potentially draw negative attention from your neighbours, Strata managers and Body Corporates.An easy way for issues to form with neighbours and property managers is having guests not being able to access a property. Whether they are knocking on neighbours\u2019 doors or milling round in reception areas, it is always best practice to keep guest activity at a minimum to eliminate any potential disturbances.When setting up or communicating the check-in process, make sure that all instructions are straightforward and obvious to avoid any potential misunderstandings.Writing and curating the property\u2019s content on Airbnb is a simple and direct way to remove any undesirable guests. Specific filters such as \"no parties\" and \"no smoking\" help attract the right guests for the property. Airbnb also offers additional instructions such a \"make a minimum security deposit of $200\" to further ensure that the property is only allowing the best guests to stay. The most detrimental facet of short term lettings for owner/manager relations is not having transparent communications.Management companies like Airsorted offer a point of contact for Strata managers and Body Corporate members if there is ever an issue with a guest. Airsorted will even introduce themselves to neighbours and property managers to ensure an open and transparent future relationship.Ultimately, short-term lettings allow owners both flexibility and potentially higher returns \u2013 however, whether an investor is a full-time landlord or travelling ex-pat, the property needs to be managed effectively in order to minimise any conflict with neighbours, guests, strata managers and Body Corporates. Effective short-term rental properties can\u2019t be managed with a hands-off approach. Airsorted helps to protect your best asset by maximising profit opportunities and providing constant support for your guests.

Market fundamentals are forecast to remain challenging in the short-term, putting downward pressure on apartment values and rents as apartment supply is absorbed. Thanks to Queensland\u2019s stable economic outlook, the report expects continued population growth to bolster housing demand across the next few years.When it comes to supply, completions continue to drop. Apartment approvals fell 30.8 per cent over the 12 months to January 2018. A total of 3,849 apartment dwellings were approved over this same period with the highest concentration in South Brisbane (25 per cent), Fortitude Valley (15 per cent) and West End (11 per cent). Commencements are expected to remain limited in the short to medium term as supply is absorbed. The report faults credit constraints which continue to be the largest hurdle for developers wanting to progress to the construction phase of their projects.

[14.84323501586914, 4.238368988037109, "By Jon Ellis, InvestoristIt\u2019s no secret that Chinese, Malaysian and Indonesian buyers remain attracted the Australian property market because of our stable government, world-renowned schools, lifestyle plus the opportunity to grow businesses for some. These fundamentals remain despite the challenges imposed this year by greater financing restrictions and increased taxes for foreign buyers of property.With 2017 fast approaching, the New Year is a time to reflect - what worked, what didn\u2019t and what to prioritise to ensure a successful year ahead. In the property industry, many developers are probably considering waiting until the first quarter of 2017 to launch their new projects to offshore channels and buyers.There\u2019s no time to waste. If developers are looking to tap into the huge Asian buyer market, the time to formulate relationships, educate and condition the market is now \u2013 before the Christmas/new Year break.Here are some things to consider\u00a0in regards to engaging the Asian market everyone is chasing and the benefits associated with projects going live now, before getting too far into the New Year.1. The Asian Market Doesn\u2019t Sleep Over The Christmas Break With no official holidays in China unlike Australia, the Asian buyer market is alive and kicking during Christmas and the first half of January. Friends, family and colleagues discussing what and where to buy property is how interest is generated in particular projects and momentum builds. You want your brand and projects to be exposed to the market so you\u2019re part of those conversations, while the topic is hot in the lead up to Chinese New Year.Our General Manager Asia, Karen Chau, says \u201cthe contrast between the Australian and Chinese property marketplaces at this time of year is dramatic.\"In Australia we are used to winding down from mid December with many people on holiday for most of January.\"Here in Shanghai and Beijing, it\u2019s the opposite. Our team is flat out keeping up with the level of enquiry we have from our network partners seeking new properties to fill their clients\u2019 briefs\u201d2. Numbers On Your Side Whilst we see increasing enquiry from Malaysian and Indonesian buyers, Chinese buyers are still the leaders in the purchase of international property. According to FIRB\u2019s latest annual report, the value of approvals for foreign investment in Australian real estate increased 75 per cent last financial year to $61 billion, with Chinese accounting for around two-thirds of applications, so exposure to these cashed-up Chinese buyers is critical.If you\u2019re considering delaying a project\u2019s launch to China until February or March 2017, why risk missing out on potential buyers who have committed to projects they\u2019ve already been shown? This side of Christmas and January, due to less competition, the numbers are still likely to be on your side.3. Capitalise On An Earlier Chinese New Year This year marks the earliest Chinese New Year for the past five years on January 28 , 2017.The New Year is the most important annually recurring festival for people of Chinese ancestry all over the world. It\u2019s been celebrated for 1,000 years - possibly much longer - and the traditions involved are deeply ingrained in Chinese culture.For many, it\u2019s a religious holiday, full of prayers, offerings and other acts of devotion. Real estate purchases are also top of mind for many people seeking new homes, fresh starts or investments. It is also known as \u2018Golden Week\u2019 by property professionals for this reason, given so many Chinese make purchase decisions during this time.The months leading up to the Chinese holiday are an extremely busy time for Chinese brokers, trying to educate their clients and close deals before the break. However, after the holidays usually comes chaos from the buying side and many projects are vying for a piece of that action. So, the earlier your project can engage the end buyers, the better your chances are at closing deals.Historically, the Rooster is also the epitome of loyalty and punctuality. For ancestors who had no alarm clocks, the crowing was significant, as it could awaken people to get up and start to work \u2013 symbolic of developers who may need a jump start in launching their project and generating success with Asian buyers.Investorist Founder and CEO\u00a0Jon Ellis is a property development marketing expert, who has developed and executed marketing strategies for over 80 property developments, including some of the nation\u2019s most significant projects and new suburb creations."]

[15.02791976928711, 4.371481895446777, "Buying your first property development site is one of the most exciting, yet daunting things, you\u2019ll ever do.Every seasoned property developer will tell you that the success of your project is created when you buy, not when you sell. This couldn\u2019t be more true, as most property developers wear their mistakes as battle wounds that remind them constantly of the potential pitfalls associated with buying a property development site.So, what could possibly go wrong? We\u2019ve identified eight potential pitfalls to avoid when buying a property development site.\u00a01. Easements, Encumbrances and Interests One of the first things you will need to do is engage your solicitor to undertake a Title Search of the property to identify whether there are any legal easements, encumbrances or interests over the property.An easement is a section of land registered on your property title that provides another party the right to use the land for a specific purpose despite not being the land owner. For example, a shared driveway (registered); or statutory easements (not registered) on your title, such as power or telephone lines, or drainage easements.Other encumbrances or interests over property include memorials (e.g. reclaimed swampland), registered mortgages (e.g. debts owing to a bank), or caveats (e.g. a legal or statutory claim against the property.)\u00a02. Environmental or Contaminated Land Register You\u2019ll need to confirm that the property is not listed on any environmental or contaminated land registers. Again, this is one for your solicitor.Why is this important? Well, if your property is listed on a register as being contaminated, then the cost of removing or remediating (e.g. treating) the property will be an additional expense over and above your standard construction cost.Whilst your solicitor will be able to tell you whether the site is listed on a register, there is still a possibility that it may be unregistered and still contaminated.Subsequently, for small and large developments, it is wise to engage an environmental engineer to undertake a report confirming that the site is unaffected by contamination as part of your formal due diligence period.\u00a03. Potential Road Resumptions Local councils and State Governments across the country plan for future road corridors by creating road resumption zones that are registered on a number of different platforms. It\u2019s often tricky to determine, however your town planner and/or solicitor should be able to determine whether your property is affected.The impact of a road resumption is that you may lose a small (or even significant) portion of your developable area, therefore seriously impacting the profitability of your project.\u00a04. Heritage and/or Character Protection Is there an existing building on the property that looks like it\u2019s been around for more than a few decades? Well, if so, there\u2019s every chance the building may be protected by heritage or character overlays.These overlays may be determined by local authorities and/or State Governments. Again, ask your town planner and/or solicitor to run the ruler over the property and confirm either way.\u00a05. Unpaid Land Tax and Council Rates This is a pretty obvious, yet a frequently forgotten one. Ask your solicitor to run a check on whether there are any outstanding land taxes or council rates over the property. You don\u2019t want to be liable for these, let alone bothered having to deal with the administrative time waste associated with it.\u00a06. Underground Services and Infrastructure When you start digging, it\u2019s far more likely that you\u2019ll hit essential services than a dinosaur!What are these services? They can include sewer, water, gas, electricity, stormwater and telecommunications (e.g. NBN, fibre optics).And why is this important? Firstly, it will affect your design as some of these services cannot be built over. And secondly, it may impact your civil construction costs as you may need to extend, relocate or upgrade the service infrastructure to support the additional demand for services created by your development.Ask your town planner and/or solicitor to run a search (for example, in Queensland you can run a Dial Before You Dig search) that will provide a map of where the essential underground services are located.\u00a07. Vegetation Protection or Overlays You will need to ensure that you are aware of any vegetation, environmental or biodiversity protections and overlays that exist over your property.What are they? These protection orders and overlays are designed to preserve green corridors, significant vegetation or environmental habitats that are considered significant in the eyes of the local and State authorities.Why is this important? Well, they can seriously hurt the viability of your development as these restrictions may drastically impact your development yield and/or significantly increase the cost of your construction.Again, your town planner and/or solicitor will be able to guide you through this process.\u00a08. Compliance Certificates Is the existing property approved for the use that it is currently operating as? Are the correct approvals in place? Are you buying an illegal property, such as an unapproved boarding house or student accommodation?Ask your town planner and/or solicitor to confirm the existing use of the property is compliant and certified by the relevant authorities.\u00a09. Flooding And finally, we all remember the devastation associated with the Brisbane floods in 2011 and 2013, especially the property developers whose development sites went under!This is of particular relevance to the Queenslanders out there, however it is still very relevant wherever you are. Flooding occurs across the country and even in the major cities of the world, such as New York and London.As climate change and urbanisation collide, our cities are under increasing pressure to defend against natural disaster and the environment. Subsequently, councils are more focused than ever to build resilience into our urban fabric.Ask your town planner to review the property against the relevant flooding codes to ensure that you\u2019re not affected or, if you are, that you have a solution in hand.Confused?

What\u2019s your outlook for the next 12-18 months for the Australian real estate market?AS: Land infill sites within a close proximity to the CBD are becoming extremely hard to come by. I believe newly-released projects within close proximity to our major centres will remain in high demand. However, as developers compete on the national stage to attract astute purchasers, they will need to offer a point of difference to remain relevant and sought after. [Related reading: Developers Need to Shift their Focus in a Changing Market]TUD: Sydney and Melbourne tend to drive the national headline growth figures, what is your opinion on the \u201cvalue gap\u201d between these two cities and the rest of the country?AS: I believe Melbourne offers a genuine value proposition when compared with Sydney. To cite a recent example, we are involved with Salta\u2019s Park House project in the suburb of Abbotsford \u2013 less than 3km from the Melbourne CBD. Park House is positioned on a large north facing parcel of land on the banks of the Yarra River. Offered at less than $11,000 per square metre with exemplary design by SJB Architects and Carr Design Interiors. By contrast you would need to go far along the Parramatta River west of Sydney to get close to that value. Sentiment for the off-the-plan apartment market in Brisbane is one of caution \u2013 enquiry levels are down, and buyers remain scarce. However, I believe in comparison to the two southern states, south-east Queensland\u2019s apartment market represents not only an affordable entry price but an excellent opportunity. It may take a leap of faith purchasing into counter-cyclical conditions, but those with a medium to long term view will be rewarded. I have personally assisted close friends of mine (Sydneysiders), to buy into this market for investment purposes using their superannuation (SMSF).TUD: You work in Sydney, what stands out about the Sydney market at the moment?AS: I believe it is difficult to categorise Sydney as one market \u2013 rather there are several \"sub markets\" that make up the overall greater Sydney metropolitan area.As an example, the Sydney inner-city area, including harbour front and CBD, will continue to remain in high demand. Sydney is a truly international city and on par with New York, London, Singapore and Hong Kong. Yet on a square metre rate comparison I believe there is still value in the super prime and prestige end of the market. The inner ring suburbs (inner west, inner east, lower and upper north shore), will also remain in strong demand. In 2018, we will be bringing a number of small- to medium-sized projects to the market from Neutral Bay to Warrawee. Outer lying areas such as Auburn, Kellyville, Mays Hill (to name a few), will also remain in demand and are typically offered at a lower entry price addressing the notion of affordability for both investors and owners alike.TUD: What makes a good developer? What developments stand out to you as examples of thoughtful and well-designed development?AS: Developers that set about creating buildings they can be proud of and stand the test of time will continue to strengthen their brands. A new breed of developers also see sustainability and the notion of being conscious of our carbon footprint as extremely important elements as a mandate. One of the best examples in recent times is the standout success of Frasers' One Central Park, Chippendale in Sydney. Led in the early days by the vision of Dr Stanley Quek, the precinct is now nearing complete realisation and has won a series of international acclaim. It is a triumph for modern apartment living and will go down in history as the benchmark for true urban regeneration. TUD: Have you noticed a marked impact on the real estate market from APRA-imposed lending restrictions, regulations targeting foreign investment, or China\u2019s crackdown on outbound investment? AS: APRA has introduced a number of measures designed to dampen the enthusiasm and appetite for foreign buyers. When combined with the capital outflow restrictions from China, off-shore Chinese enquiry has dropped significantly.  Long term I see the demand for Australia as a destination of choice will remain high. Drivers will not change \u2013 clean air, fresh fruit and vegetables, high-quality education as well as a safe long term investment solution will continue to drive demand from China and South East Asia in general. TUD: In the past year have you noticed an uplift (or decline) in buyer sentiment generally?AS: Over the last year we have seen a decline in numbers of enquiry levels. In today\u2019s terms buyers are more informed than they ever have been. Potential purchasers are extremely well-researched and will make an actual enquiry only once they are confident with what the research is telling them. With that understood, the role of the sales agent is now all about relationship selling. An enquiry today may lead to a sale in twelve months\u2019 time. TUD: Is the so-called \u201cgreat Australian dream\u201d of owning your own home \u2014 and backyard \u2014 alive, or is that changing for Australians as the population grows and cities densify?AS: Affordability will continue as a driver for not only first home buyers, but upgraders and downsizers. Those needing the space of a three or four bedroom home may look at the outer lying areas for a house and land package that meets their size and budget requirements.However, as we are becoming more and more entrenched by social drivers, demand for inner urban living will remain high. This is true across all generations from Millennials through to Baby Boomers as inner city living becomes not only acceptable but the preferred lifestyle choice. The notion of a \u2018lock-up-and-leave\u2019 lifestyle for Baby Boomers will see this group travel the world from their inner city base. However, before they spend the kid\u2019s inheritance, their children (the Millennials) will rely on the \u2018bank of mum and dad\u2019 to assist with the purchase of their first home \u2013 and also typically choose close to the action of the inner city hotspots. TUD: How did you first get started in real estate? What is your professional background?AS: I finished the HSC in 1986 and commenced a retail career working in various roles specifically in menswear. As the menswear supervisor of Italian fashion house Giorgio Armani, I built up a regular clientele of both local and international celebrities and business executives. In 1998, I sold a suit to John McGrath and explored the idea of working in real estate. John felt that my skill set and expertise in selling a rack of suits could be utilised in selling a \"vertical rack of apartments\" and I commenced as a sales agent within the newly formed projects division. After almost seven years with McGrath, I took on twelve years of developer-side roles with Multiplex, Frasers Property Group, Crown and Lendlease. This gave me an in-depth understanding of the processes and cyclical nature of off-the-plan selling. In 2016, I returned to McGrath as general manager of McGrath Projects. It would be fair to say that the last five years have seen unprecedented selling activity with record sell out scenarios at record sales prices. Having also worked through challenging conditions post GFC, I have firsthand experience in understanding a market where the buyer has a significant advantage. TUD: What\u2019s next for McGrath Projects?AS: 2018 will represent new opportunities for the team across the entire east coast. We have a number of exciting new development opportunities in the pipeline stages that will come to the market over the next six to twelve months. I see significant opportunity in Victoria in both the apartment and house and land space and I intend to build a team with experienced leaders. "]

But what we\u2019re finding is that the weight of interest is really coming from build-to-rent groups at the moment.\u201dAlthough the current boom\u2019s early mover projects, initiated two years ago, are now coming online, Hill says that the majority of build-to-rent transactions have taken place in the past 12 months.On the other side of the deal, build-to-rent developers are also reporting that agents are approaching them with tailored campaigns around suitable sites.Managing director of build-to-rent specialists Arklife Scott Ponton says \u201canything that comes to the market that has a mixed-use or residential flavour to it, agents are looking at it from a build-to-rent perspective, as well as other, more traditional build-to-sell perspectives\u201d.\u201cWe are seeing opportunities put to us as build-to-rent, when previously agents hadn\u2019t thought of that sort of thing.\u201d\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to see more of that.\u201d Head of build-to-rent operator Home Christian Grahame  agrees that agents have begun to recognise and highlight sites suitable for the sector.\u201cFor Home, prioritising proximity to transport, the local community and amenity is key.\u201d\u201cSuitable sites for build-to-rent remain challenging to identify, but agents have recognised the sector as an emerging market and are positioning some site sale campaigns specifically for build-to-rent. Two recent campaigns in North Melbourne reflect this approach.\u201dDespite recent disruptions to migration patterns, and working-from-home trends, institutional investors are banking on the long-term growth and security of build-to-rent. Funds are piling into the sector, with Gurner and Qualitas the latest to announce an oversubscribed international capital-raising for a build-to-rent platform called GQ, raising $1.2bn on a $1bn target.Qualitas\u2019 global head of real estate Mark Fischer described the build-to-rent strategy as anchored on \u201cassets generating defensive and resilient cashflows.\u201d\u201c[We] are seeing global institutional investors increasingly allocating capital to investment strategies supported by these themes.\u201cAcross Australia, we are anticipating strong and growing demand for high-quality build-to-rent assets as population growth and declining home ownership drive the need for quality rental stock.\u201cBuild-to-rent, at its heart, is a very long-term investment model,\u201d JLL\u2019s head of build-to-rent Paul Winstanley says.\u201cFor institutional-grade build-to-rent, the investment case is looking at demographics over a long period of time. Obviously, the apartment pipeline is a lot more owner-occupier focused now, which has meant that there\u2019s less investment. \u201cSo build-to-rent is the biggest opportunity, because ultimately, we need those properties.\u201dHill says that institutional appetite for build-to-rent projects sits in the 200 to 450 apartment zone, which is where economies of scale and operational efficiencies align. To assist buyers, his team is modelling specific build-to-rent demand factors on a city district level, and building detailed pitches when sites are strong.\u201cBuild-to-rent sites are typically priced on a 10-year internal rate of return cashflow basis,\u201d he says. \u201cSo what that means is these groups are pricing the completed asset, and then working backwards via residual method to deduct down to a site value, to ensure that they\u2019re hitting their return hurdles, and that\u2019s typically a 10 per cent IRR.\u201d\u201cWe work very closely with these groups to build up the assumptions and the operational investment thesis, to then work backwards towards site value.\u201dGrahame says that agents who do their groundwork are putting themselves, and their buyers, at an advantage.\u201cClear instructions to the agent and a well-prepared data room certainly make the process of evaluating a site and reaching a deal much more efficient,\u201d Grahame says.\u201cMost major agencies or transaction managers understand that the institutional capital involved in build-to-rent is demanding a high standard of due diligence and governance in any sale process.\u201dWhile developers have welcomed the recent NSW build-to-rent SEPP, and 50 per cent land tax concessions in NSW and Victoria, there\u2019s more work to be done to support the sector.\u201cThe build-to-rent sector will continue to grow but the availability of large, appropriately permitted or zoned sites is a key challenge for build-to-rent in most capital cities, particularly Sydney,\u201d Grahame says.\u201cThe complexities and uncertainty of planning systems, and increasing statutory and regulations are a disincentive for institutional investors. While Victoria and New South Wales should be commended for introducing supportive tax and some planning policies for build-to-rent, we\u2019d like to see planning processes further simplified.\u201d Hill concurs that planning remains a hurdle.\u201cGiven the early stage of the sector here, we don\u2019t really have the planning framework to separate out and identify build-to-rent as its own use,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBecause of that, essentially the only way to build a pipeline for build-to-rent is to acquire sites, either with residential permit approval or hotels, and go for change of use to accommodate build-to-rent. So we\u2019ve seen most of the activity where build-to-rent groups will have confidence in the building envelope.\u201dHill says that this might involve tweaks to internal configurations, with build-to-rent developers (and tenants) generally preferring a higher proportion of one- and two-bed apartments. But overly prescriptive planning codes can stifle the flexibility that underpins project success.\u201cBuild-to-rent assets have to be best in class in the market that they\u2019re trying to target. That could be affordable, the middle band, or premium, but they have to be best in class in design, because it\u2019s an occupier long term,\u201d he says.\u201cIf it\u2019s on the doorstep of employment, for example, it might cater to a market that\u2019s more weighted towards studio or one-bed apartments versus two- or three-beds.\u201cSites that are in different locations and might not have access to the same transport infrastructure might require components of parking, more two- or three-bed apartments, if it\u2019s more of a suburban setting.\u201d You are currently experiencing The Urban Developer Plus (TUD+), our premium membership for property professionals.

It highlights that 2016 transactions fell just 4 per cent shy of the record $29.6 billion tally set in 2014, with high level of activity largely attributable to offshore buyers.CBRE's Head of Research Australia, Stephen McNabb, said offshore investors purchased $11.7 billion of commercial real estate, accounting for 41 per cent of overall transaction activity - the highest annual percentage on record. On the flipside, domestic purchases declined by 28 per cent.\"Rising volumes of offshore investment reflect the relative attractiveness of Australia's commercial property yields in a period when interest rates have been close to 2 percentage points above major developed markets globally,\" Mr McNabb said.\"The level of activity is also consistent with the trend towards globalisation and diversification. As a result of this, Australian investors are also beginning to export more capital offshore and we may see more of this is 2016, particularly as interest rates rise in overseas markets.\"Offshore investors were particularly active in the Australian office market - acquiring more office towers than domestic buyers for the first time since CBRE began tracking these measurements in 2005.Overseas buyers accounted for 54 per cent of the annual office turnover and while there was also an increase in offshore investor dispositions net overseas investment in the office sector increased by $3 billion through the year.CBRE Executive Managing Director, Capital Markets, Mark Granter predicted that momentum would continue into 2017.\"At the beginning of 2014 the expectation was that foreign investment activity might ease however it's only grown stronger, with the available returns in Australia still more attractive than in the other gateway cities offshore,\" Mr Granter said.\"The underlying property fundamentals in Sydney and Melbourne are helping to drive activity as occupier demand improves and vacancies decline, with these markets also benefitting from the fact that not too much new supply is being delivered.\"Turning to the retail sector, CBRE's data highlights that a record $9 billion in property changed hands last year - up 24 per cent on 2014.\"With trading activity in regional centres declining, the uplift was driven by activity in sub-regional and neighbourhood centres. Sales in these sectors totalled $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion respectively and in both cases these was up by close to $1 billion on prior year levels,\" Mr McNabb said.\"Higher transaction volumes for neighbourhood and sub-regional sectors coincided with a circa 40 basis point yield compression through 2015 in these sectors, which suggests investor confidence has been buoyed by the improved retail sales backdrop, stronger tenant demand and the increased opportunity for re-development and expansion.\"The retail sector also saw further offshore investment with an increase in net investment of $1.8 billion through 2015.In the industrial sector, annual sales dipped by 15 per cent to $4.5 billion, however CBRE Senior Manager, Industrial & Logistics, Matt Haddon said it was a matter of timing rather than any slowing in activity.\"2015 was probably even more active than 2014, however a number of very large deals failed to exchange just before Christmas and will now fall into the first quarter of 2016.

While the product launch in September saw businesses on both sides of the transaction benefit from local connections, a secondary advantage has quickly emerged. With access to interstate selling agents \u2013 developers, builders and project marketers have the opportunity to reach buyers in other cities, widening the potential investment pool and increasing the chance of a sale. [Related reading: How Marketplace is Making Off-the-Plan Sales Easier than Ever] Marketplace allows project owners to publish their current projects to the platform, where a network of qualified agents are searching for off-the-plan properties to sell. Once the project is published, licensed agents who are interested in the development are able to send a connection request to the project owner. If the project owner thinks the agent is a good fit, they will approve their request to sell. This transparent process ensures the project owner has complete control over the selling process. Control over the agent-selection process is managed by a number of filters, meaning that if desired, projects are only discoverable to a select few. One of these filters is the location, which enables developers and project marketers to share their projects with selling agents in certain locations. Rather than restricting the radius to local agents only, the location filter allows project owners to reach interstate selling agents, subsequently exposing their project to a network of buyers who may be searching for investment opportunities in other cities. Take Sydney, for example, where higher levels of competition is making the purchase opportunity difficult and buyers are looking for property in other states. A recent report from realestate.com.au showed that the second most popular suburb searched by NSW off-the-plan apartment buyers was, in fact, Melbourne CBD*. Marketplace allows project owners in Melbourne and Brisbane to open their projects to selling agents based in Sydney, exposing their project to a whole new market of buyers who may recognise the benefits of investing in other cities.The ability for project owners to grow their network Australia-wide, reaching buyers they may otherwise find hard to locate, ensures the best possible chance of a seamless, off-the-plan sale.

More than 135,000 applications were made for the federal government stimulus package, with Victoria taking up the lion\u2019s share of about 30 per cent. Billed as the saviour of the nation\u2019s economy, it is undeniable that HomeBuilder helped to kickstart Australia\u2019s economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic.But it has created the perfect storm. Building approvals have begun to stall, Australian housing construction costs are at an all-time high, inflation is on its way up and pressure is mounting on interest rates. Economists are warning greenfield developers and residential construction companies will feel the impact of the pull-forward effect over the longer term. ANZ head of Australian economics David Plank says the HomeBuilder program has brought forward construction activity but it is not responsible for the rapidly escalating house prices across Australia. Plank says supply and demand forces are at play in the housing market that are driving prices sky-high in addition to inflationary pressures, as opposed to an artificial stimulus-led housing bubble. \u201cIt definitely had an impact, we saw a dramatic surge in building levels,\u201d Plank says.\u201cPeople that would have built a house in the next few years thought, \u2018we should do it now\u2019, which tends to bring forward that activity. It would have made sense that building approvals would have picked up, as is always the case with these sorts of subsidies.\u201dBut with the glut of work, supply chain issues and labour shortages the bottleneck has been challenging for construction firms looking to capitalise on the pent-up demand.National construction costs ^Source: Corelogic Cordell Construction Cost IndexPlank says the rub will come in the form of a slow-down in work in the longer term.\u201cThere will be less activity in the future which we\u2019re now starting to see, and it will decline further. Residential activity has started to slow,\u201d Plank says. \u201cWe think interest rates will get up to the 1s. We know that as interest rates go up that it will impact spending and the housing market quite materially.\u201dThe rubber has already started to hit the road with some big name residential building companies going into receivership.Queensland-based builders Privium and BA Murphy have gone into liquidation. BA Murphy reportedly owed almost $11 million to about 550 creditors while Privium likely owed more, according to administrators FTI Consulting.Privium Group\u2019s director Robert Harder attributed the collapse to the effects of the pandemic on operations, which led to a blowout in lead times and restrictions on work sites. The administrators say the costs of construction outpacing revenue growth had also played into the demise of the builder. Melbourne-based high-rise builder ABD Group went into liquidation with outstanding debts in excess of $50 million, while Hobart-based Inside Out Construction folded in November, and Tasmanian Constructions, a franchisee of Hotondo Homes, has entered liquidation with 80 contractors and 40 customers left out of pocket. CreditorWatch chief economist Harley Dale says the construction industry has grappled with the challenges of the pandemic and has the highest payment arrears at 12.4 per cent across the sectors monitored.\u201cThe construction industry has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic,\u201d Dale says.\u201cThe industry has some unique payment structures which are contributing to a high rate of arrears. If the industry can work through its supply chain disruptions and blowouts in the cost of materials such as timber, it will be in good stead.\u201dCommsec senior economist Ryan Felsman says securing building materials and labour is difficult in the housing market at the moment.\u201cA combination of strong demand for new homes and renovation work due to record low interest rates, the government\u2019s HomeBuilder stimulus, and state government grants have generated strong building activity,\u201d Felsman says.\u201cOverall building construction costs surged 2.9 per cent in the December quarter and were up a massive 7.5 per cent at the end of December when compared with the previous year. A scarcity of skilled workers and a surge in building materials costs due to supply chain and transportation bottlenecks, have contributed to soaring building construction costs.\u201dFelsman says input prices to house construction surged 12 per cent over the year to December as supply constraints, stock shortages and surging freight costs bite into bottom lines.He said key building materials including timber and joinery had increased 18.4 per cent over the year, while aluminium windows and doors have increased 13.2 per cent.Corelogic\u2019s Cordell construction cost index for the last quarter of 2021 showed that national construction costs had increased 7.3 per cent over the year, the highest annual growth rate since March 2005.Corelogic director of research Tim Lawless says supply chain disruptions would continue to create upward pressure on the cost of construction.\u201cThere is a significant amount of residential construction work in the pipeline that has been approved but not yet completed,\u201d Lawless says.\u201cWith some materials such as timber and metal products reportedly remaining in short supply, there is the possibility some residential projects will be delayed or run over budget.\u201dCordell data shows that cost increases are still being driven primarily by timber (mostly structural timber). Other segments of the market also remain volatile, with increasing pressure on metal costs.Dwelling approvals: December 2021^Source: ABS Building Approvals December 2021The Australian Bureau of Statistics released building approvals data for December, highlighting the demise of house building, which dropped 1.8 per cent over the month, while unit approvals skyrocketed 27.5 per cent. The drop in house build approvals in December follows a 1.6 per cent contraction in November, and a record 21.3 per cent decrease over 12 months. Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe acknowledges the stronger GDP and labour market outcomes have translated into \u201chigher inflation than we were expecting\u201d.\u201cWe had expected underlying inflation to be 1.25 per cent over 2021, yet the actual outcome was 2.6 per cent,\u201d he says.\u201cHeadline inflation was higher still at 3.5 per cent, boosted primarily by a sharp increase in petrol prices and the cost of constructing new homes.\u201dWhile the RBA maintains a dovish stance on monetary policy Lowe says while the omicron variant outbreak has delayed the recovery of the economy he is confident it has not been derailed.

While Courtenay's character is evidently gay, he is not the only one: the often talked about Mr. Davenport-Scott is the other, and the reason that he is never seen, the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in England at the time.<br /><br />We can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled Norman, Courtenay's character: and we can also see in a passing remark by Oxenby, the Edward Fox character, the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters, and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it. The abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir has been anticipated all the way through, if this subtext is included: it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to. The flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that Courtenay has to 'step into the footlights', as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids, a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous, but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man's inner torment.<br /><br />So while the drama is of the decline of Finney's Sir, a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal flaw' of Courtenay's gayness, and makes this a film about him, as the title suggests.<br /><br />The art direction, pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time, more distant than the eighties and, in some ways, even than the second world war. The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order, of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant, for all its flaws."]

Other writers have commented on the shifts in tone, the confusion of plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend it. The score is one of Henry Mancini's best (and he has written many wonderful ones), several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews, Julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes, (she is at her absolutely loveliest here), the on-location shots are breath-taking, and there are some funny Inspector Clouseau-type sight gags to boot. Rock Hudson basically phoned in his performance, but he is passably good. A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film Julie did for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor to Victor/Victoria. It is lovely to look at and listen to. When will it be available on DVD??? When it is, I for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter, director's cut. Since it was lampooned in S.O.B., they would make a great two-pack!"]

No matter, the sheer presence of Julie Andrews, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes, add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release. Supposedly, this is the only version that Edwards would allow; but, Turner Classic Movies has shown the complete (theatrical release) version, recently. Recommended."]

After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner well. I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted Costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs.

Both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie.

Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. In a brilliant Disney parody, he hollers \"Pinocchio\" down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with, followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' which, as a child, I used to impersonate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. I've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimson's best."]

Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman. She epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary. Each successive event Rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly. She wasn't a dictator devoid of compassion, but in fact she was quite the opposite. She displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself.<br /><br />Merkerson did a good job, but I believe this role was right up her alley anyway. The movie had an even keel never straying from Rachel. There were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected. Nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than Rachel herself."]

This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, superb direction by George C. Wolfe, and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! Yes, it is just that good.<br /><br />The story is based on the author's life as the child 'Junior' (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel \"Nanny\" Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson), a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny. The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on and on.<br /><br />In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role, a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years, and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie, she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe award.<br /><br />The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dancing, and joy. The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story.

Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. <br /><br />The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. Nanny's ability \"to take fragments and make them whole\" affects everyone within her sphere. An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband, telling him firmly, \"If you ever touch that child again, we're going to dance!\" As delivered by actress S. Epatha Merkerson, that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks. <br /><br />From start to finish, Merkerson delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home.

Set during the second world war,it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second - rate touring Shakespearean Company comprising an equal number of has - beens and wannabes led by \"Sir\", a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called \"The Old School\".Whatever part he is playing he grabs centre - stage and bellows out over the footlights,bullying his audience into applause.But,somewhere inside him,buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out,there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness.It is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for. Mr A.Finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham,often to the point of caricature,and,just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor. The same goes for Mr T.Courtenay.It's easy to write off his portrayal<br /><br />of Norman as an exercise in stereotyping.Here we have a middle - aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life,enjoying the company of \"The Girls\" and loving the wicked Insider gossip rife in \"The Theatre\".There were - and I strongly suspect still are - many men just like Norman in The Profession.Infinitely kind and patient,knowing more about the plays than many of the actors,they run backstage with wisdom and affection.I believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at Mr Courtenay's portrait. I saw \"The Dresser\" on the London stage where,against the perceived wisdom,Mr Courtenay's \"Norman\" was rather more subdued than in the movie.\"Sir\" was played by the great Mr Freddie Jones to huge acclaim from the audience.It was a memorable performance that overshadowed Mr Courtenay's,reducing him rather to an \"also - ran\" as opposed to an actor on level - billing.The idea that \"Sir\" and \"Norman\" might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window. \"Norman\" was reduced to being his puppet,which I'm not sure was what Ronald Harwood intended,but made for breathtaking theatre. Messrs Finney and Courtenay redress the balance in the movie,restoring equality to the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the British \"New Wave\" pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely Leftish,\"middle - class and ashamed of it\" movement.When the British cinema virtually committed Hari - kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.With the renaissance of more substantial movies,they re - appeared,blinking in the unaccustomed bright light.<br /><br />\"The Dresser\" marked their return,still fizzing with energy and talent, shouting to the world at large \"We're still here\".It's not a big movie but is assuredly a great one."]

Oh, it was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto jersey up in the Quebec area - disaster! That especially holds true in the glory years of Les Canadians. However, that doesn't make the story funny. <br /><br />Back in the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces idolized the Montreal Canadians and their star player, Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him.

On paper it looks like stunt casting. Yes let's round up all the black folks in Hollywood and put them in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I didn't see was Oprah's ,thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie. Instead this movie was not some sentimental mess. It was moving but not phony, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer in question. The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny, Mrs Bill Crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people. Now being a jaded New Yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man, I'm thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going. Getting folks jobs and taking the medicare/caid checks But no she explains to Lou Gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time. I think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded New Yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks.(g) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal(g).. She almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes I can see why. She is married to a ne'er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her.

I re-winded the scene few times ..one time because I didn't know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff. But she is so good here. I actually know people who act just like her. So it was very real to me Macy Grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good. I was very happy that they did not kill Nanny off. I thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People we might know or even lived with. Thank god for them, I do not know how they do it all of the time. I have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever I am feeling selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood.

Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, with no strings attached. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.<br /><br />Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.<br /><br />Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful play. Working with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of Ms. Crosby, when his own parents are not around to take care of him. Ms. Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben; in a way, he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some of the characters, as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between Nanny and the young Ruben, played with such charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin, who is a natural. The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive, as it doesn't clarify, or justify what one is seeing. Frankly, just by watching the interaction of the players, is self explanatory.<br /><br />In the background there is always music. No matter what hard times these people are going through, but Nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era.<br /><br />Aside from Ms. Merkerson, other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the rising stars of the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr.,Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest.<br /><br />Ms. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience.

Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, though. For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie, but I wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end.

This joyous motion picture experience is centered around Santiago-Hudson's childhood guardian, Rachel \"Nanny\" Crosby, a strong, big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950's. Nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks, derelicts, cripples, drug addicts, misfits, and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out. The crux of the story revolves around Nanny's relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin),a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so Nanny took him in. S. Epatha Merkeson, who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBC's LAW & ORDER, turns in a powerhouse performance as Nanny, the neighborhood mother-figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town. Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. Merkeson is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons, Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def, and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored, this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels, but if for no other reason, is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by S. Epatha Merkeson, who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it."]

The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too, for Germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic. Lili's target is William Larrabee, a charismatic U.S. squadron leader who can supply her valuable information. The plot thickens comes when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy, and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes. She gets jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affections, then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business. The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI has ended, as she sings the theme song of the film, \"Wishing\" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of Larrabee's squadron appear, including her lover himself, indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of \"It's a Long To Tipperraree\", to indicate all is well with the world again. This is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of \"John Goldfarb\" fame; and it is a delightful narrative. Larrabee's squadron, including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and realization. Credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and to Russell Harlan for his shining cinematography. In the beautiful footage, the principal actors are Julie Andrews as Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp outstanding as Lili's Uncle Kurt, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as the inebriate pilot, gorgeous Gloria Paul as Lili's stripteasing rival, and many other fine actors in smaller parts. It is hard to say enough nice things about the pace, or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by Edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare, to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization.. This comedy also helps prepare the way for Lili's conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing. This is a rare \"sense-of-life\" film about Lili's \"Americanization\", her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen. It is haunting, I find, and beautiful in many ways. I consider it to be Blake Edwards'masterpiece of directing; and under the title \"The Americanization of Lili\" I believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard I know."]

Probably has to do with his simian features.<br /><br />It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. My concerns briefly bristled at Kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make George Clooney proud? Yeah, we get it. I was totally ready to hate him.<br /><br />But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. <br /><br />Darn you, ape man! Efficiently mixing tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can quibble about its clich\u00e9s, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that takes away from the entertainment value.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group.<br /><br />Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded, panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. And if all that isn't bad enough, sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies.<br /><br />Man, who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought I'd have an Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /><br />Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers.<br /><br />THE GIST <br /><br />Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but had I paid I would've felt I had gotten my money's worth."]

A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class Blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture. The characters of Santiago-Hudson's play depicted Black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love,loyalty and honor. Although the characters moved away from those values at times, they did not deny the importance of the values. Instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters, without judgment, that passed through the life of \"nanny\". The central characters were strong and believable, the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by-gone era. Pre-integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication, sight, sound,and smell, that could almost be experienced by watching the drama \"Lackawanna Blues\" unfold. I will watch it again and again."]
[0.9217050075531006, 5.902468681335449, "This movie is certainly well-constructed, beginning and ending in the dark, with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt, Julie Andrews,initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy.<br /><br />It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. While it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown, 'cinema vulgaris', and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong. Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.<br /><br />The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates. One must just buy into the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. Overlooking the tepid chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one must believe that these are lovers - who in all innocence fall for each other. And in the end, love is far more important than winning wars. And so is maintaining innocence.<br /><br />There is a lot of understated acting, and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies.<br /><br />There are wonderful comedic elements (foreshadowing the French goons in Victor/Victoria), interesting diplomatic asides (reminding me of The Tamarind Seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of good-will.<br /><br />Suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away. Julie Andrews' belting out of war songs and the haunting 'Whistling Away the Dark' are reason enough to turn the TV on, just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number, like the 'Jenny' number in Star! works. <br /><br />This film has, like a good champagne, aged well. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same applies to transferring the laser disk of Star! to DVD. These are both interesting pieces of Julie Andrews' meticulous and then underrated works."]
